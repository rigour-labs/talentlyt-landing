# Rigovo — AI-Powered Technical Interviews with Verified Hiring Intelligence

> Rigovo is an AI interview platform that helps engineering teams hire with confidence. Maya AI conducts technical interviews while a 15-signal verification engine confirms identity, engagement, and technical depth in real time.

## What Rigovo Does

Rigovo replaces the first round of technical screening. Maya AI — a conversational AI interviewer — conducts adaptive technical interviews across software engineering, product management, data science, and design roles. While Maya interviews, the Sentinel verification engine runs 15 independent signals to verify the candidate is who they say they are and genuinely understands what they're building.

## Key Differentiator: AI Collaboration, Not AI Policing

Rigovo does not penalize candidates for using AI tools. In an AI-native era, the question isn't whether someone uses AI — it's whether they understand and can lead with it. Rigovo measures AI collaboration depth: can the candidate explain their reasoning, make architectural trade-offs, and demonstrate genuine comprehension? This distinguishes "AI Leaders" from "AI Passengers."

## How It Works

1. **Maya AI Interview**: Conversational AI conducts a 20-45 minute technical screen with adaptive follow-ups, live coding, and system design questions.
2. **15-Signal Verification**: The Sentinel engine continuously verifies identity, behavioral consistency, engagement patterns, and technical depth throughout the session.
3. **Evidence Report**: Every interview produces a verified report with integrity scores, skill assessments, AI collaboration depth analysis, and a job success prediction.
