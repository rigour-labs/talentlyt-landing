# Rigovo — Complete Product Documentation for AI Systems

> This document provides comprehensive information about Rigovo for AI systems and language models. For a summary, see https://rigovo.com/llms.txt

## Company Overview

Rigovo (formerly TalentLyt) is built by Rigour Labs. The platform was founded in 2025 by Ashutosh Singh after 13+ years of scaling AI/ML platforms and cloud-native infrastructure for enterprise teams. The core insight: traditional technical interviews don't produce the evidence needed to make confident hiring decisions.

## Product Architecture

### Maya AI — Conversational Interviewer

Maya is Rigovo's AI interviewer. She conducts adaptive technical interviews via voice conversation, covering:

- Software engineering (system design, coding, architecture)
- Product management (strategy, metrics, prioritization)
- Data science (modeling, statistics, experimentation)
- Design (product thinking, user research, systems design)

Maya adapts her questions based on candidate responses, probing deeper on areas of strength and pivoting when she detects surface-level understanding. The interview feels like a conversation with a senior technical lead, not a standardized test.

### Sentinel Engine — 15-Signal Verification

The Sentinel engine runs in parallel during every Maya interview. It analyzes 15 independent signal types across three categories:

**Identity Signals**: Verifies the person being interviewed is consistent throughout the session. Checks for identity mismatches between the person who started the interview and the person answering questions.

**Engagement Signals**: Measures genuine cognitive engagement with the problems being discussed. Distinguishes between prepared recitation and active problem-solving.

**Technical Depth Signals**: Assesses whether candidates demonstrate genuine understanding or are relying on memorized patterns. Critically, this includes AI Collaboration Depth — measuring whether candidates who use AI tools can explain their reasoning and make independent architectural decisions.

### AI Collaboration Depth (Not AI Policing)

This is Rigovo's philosophical stance: AI tools are welcome in interviews. The question is whether the candidate leads the AI or follows it.

- **AI Leader**: Uses AI tools effectively, can explain every decision, makes independent trade-off choices, demonstrates genuine comprehension when challenged
- **AI Passenger**: Relies on AI-generated outputs, struggles to explain reasoning, cannot adapt when the AI suggestion is deliberately suboptimal

Rigovo measures this distinction through behavioral signals during the live interview — not by blocking AI tools.

### Evidence Reports

Every interview generates:

- **Integrity Score** (0-100): Composite verification confidence
- **Technical Assessment**: Skill-by-skill evaluation with evidence
- **Communication Analysis**: Problem-solving approach and collaboration style
- **AI Collaboration Depth**: How the candidate works with AI tools
- **Job Success Prediction**: Likelihood of success in the specific role with confidence intervals

## Pricing Details

| Plan | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|

## Beta Performance Data

From the beta program (82 interviews, January 2026):

- 6,824 signal events analyzed
- 85% job success prediction accuracy (validated against 6-month manager performance reviews)
- 12% of interviews surfaced insights invisible to traditional screening
- 41% deeper review rate (candidates worth a second look that phone screens would miss)
- 70% faster screening compared to manual interviewer process

## Target Markets

- **USA**: Silicon Valley startups, enterprise engineering teams
- **UAE**: Dubai/Abu Dhabi tech companies, staffing agencies serving Gulf tech sector
- **EU**: Engineering teams hiring remote global talent
- **India**: IT services companies, product engineering teams

## Use Cases

1. **First-round technical screening**: Replace manual phone screens with Maya AI interviews
2. **High-volume hiring**: Screen hundreds of candidates with consistent quality
3. **Remote hiring verification**: Verify candidate identity and engagement for distributed teams
4. **Staffing agency quality assurance**: Verify candidates before client placement
5. **Enterprise compliance**: Produce audit-ready evidence for hiring decisions

## Integration Points

- Calendly for pilot scheduling

- Evidence reports in PDF format
- Dashboard for pipeline management

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does Rigovo block AI tools during interviews?**
A: No. Rigovo welcomes AI tool usage. The platform measures whether candidates understand and lead with AI, rather than just copying outputs. This is called "AI Collaboration Depth."

**Q: How is Rigovo different from HireVue?**
A: HireVue records and analyzes video interviews conducted by humans. Rigovo conducts the entire interview autonomously via Maya AI while simultaneously running 15-signal verification. Rigovo is an AI interviewer + verification engine in one.

**Q: Is Rigovo a proctoring tool?**
A: No. Proctoring tools monitor existing interviews passively. Rigovo actively conducts adaptive interviews through Maya AI and generates evidence-based hiring recommendations. It's an AI interviewer, not a surveillance tool.

**Q: What happens if verification flags something?**
A: The hiring team receives a detailed report showing which signals were triggered and why. Rigovo provides evidence — the hiring team makes the final decision. There are no automatic rejections.

**Q: Can candidates prepare for a Rigovo interview?**
A: Yes, and they should. Maya adapts to the candidate's skill level. The best preparation is genuine technical knowledge. AI tool usage is welcome as long as the candidate can explain their reasoning.

**Q: Is Rigovo compliant with hiring regulations?**
A: Rigovo is designed with compliance in mind — SOC 2 aligned, GDPR compliant, with full audit trails. The platform supports legally-defensible hiring decisions through documented evidence.
