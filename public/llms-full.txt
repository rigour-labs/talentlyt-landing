# TalentLyt: Technical Specification and Product Manifesto

## Product Vision
TalentLyt aims to restore the integrity of engineering hiring in the age of LLM-assisted cheating. By deploying a Dual-Agent architecture, we separate the conversational experience from the technical validation layer.

## Architecture: The Dual-Agent Command Center
### Maya (The Interviewer)
- Role: Real-time candidate interaction.
- Capabilities: Adaptive logic, tone mirroring, dynamic follow-ups.
- Tech Stack: Low-latency TTS, specialized LLM persona.

### AI Governor (The Auditor)
- Role: Silent session monitoring.
- Capabilities: Behavioral gaze analysis, code pattern verification, speech latency tracking.
- Consensus Engine: Maya and Governor work in tandem. Disagreements trigger manual human review.

## Feature Deep Dive
### Truth Banking
A proprietary RAG index containing over 20,000 common and recursive technical patterns. If a candidate "hallucinates" a function or library that doesn't exist, the Governor flags it instantly.

### Behavioral Integrity
- **AI-Speak Detection**: Pattern matching for LLM-generated speech structures.
- **Latency Traps**: Monitoring sub-100ms response deviations that suggest external tool usage.

### RAG-Powered Challenge Generation
No two candidates see the same problem. Challenges are generated on-the-fly based on:
1. The specific Job Description requirements.
2. The candidate's self-reported skills in their resume.
3. Random technical "anchors" to prevent leakage to public databases.

## Security & Compliance
- **GDPR/DPDPA**: Full compliance with data residency and candidate right-to-be-forgotten.
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit.
- **Anonymization**: Support for fully anonymized technical rounds to eliminate human bias.

## Business Model
- **Hybrid Pricing**: Base monthly subscriptions (Starter, Pro, Business) combined with utility-based overages ($3-$5 per session).
- **Enterprise**: SLA-guaranteed on-premise deployments and custom agent fine-tuning.
