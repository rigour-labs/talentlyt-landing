# TalentLyt: Technical Specification and Product Manifesto

## Product Vision
TalentLyt aims to restore the integrity of engineering hiring in the age of LLM-assisted cheating. By deploying a high-fidelity **Forensic Hierarchy**, we separate the conversational experience from the technical validation layer, ensuring a 100% verified technical signal.

## Architecture: The Sentinel Hierarchy
The core of TalentLyt is a multi-modal agentic system that performs continuous cross-verification between interaction and auditing layers.

### Maya (The Conversational Lead)
- **Role**: Real-time candidate interaction and adaptive screening.
- **Vision-Sync (Multi-modal Context)**: Maya utilizes Vision-Sync (powered by synchronized multi-modal embeddings) for real-time context awareness, matching non-verbal signals with technical performance.
- **Adaptive Challenge Engine**: Dynamically adjusts interview depth based on candidate performance, ensuring high-density signal extraction.

### Cognitive-Audit (The Truth Engine)
- **Role**: Silent, real-time reasoning stream monitoring.
- **Reasoning Stream (Forensic Engine)**: The AI Forensic Engine performs instantaneous verification of technical statements, code architecture, and logic flow against a vast "Technical Truth Bank".
- **Consensus Engine**: Continuous agreement loop between Maya and the Auditor. If the Auditor detects a deviation (potential hallucination or external tool use), it flags the session instantly.

## Feature Deep Dive
### Truth Banking & RAG Verification
A proprietary Technical Truth Bank contains deep static analysis and recursive technical patterns. If a candidate hallucinates a framework feature or library, the Forensic Engine identifies the lack of grounding instantly.

### Behavioral Integrity Telemetry
- **Micro-Latency Analysis**: Monitoring sub-100ms response deviations indicative of copy-pasting or external tool queries.
- **SVG Gaze & Motion Vectors**: Visual tracking of focus points to ensure candidate engagement and detect environmental aids.
- **Pattern Matching**: Identifying structural markers of LLM-generated speech (robotic filler, perfect syntax alignment, boilerplate structures).

### JIT Challenge Generation
Challenges are generated "Just-In-Time" based on:
1. **Target JD**: Grounded in specific team requirements.
2. **Resume Entropy**: Verifying self-reported edge cases in the candidate's history.
3. **Randomized Technical Anchors**: Preventing "leakage" to public interview prep databases.

## Security, Privacy & Ethics
- **Privacy-First**: Full privacy-centric design with standard data protection protocols and local-only data processing options for Enterprise.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Standardized evaluation protocols verified by two independent AI agents, removing human heuristic bias.
- **Data Integrity**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit.

## Forensic Access Layers (Pricing)
1. **The Pilot ($29)**: 3x Full Sentinel Audits. Zero-storage ID verification. Neural calibration maps.
2. **The Starter ($15/int)**: Pay-as-you-go scalability. Unified integrity scoring. Biometric continuity sync.
3. **The Engine ($249/mo)**: Standard for scale. Includes 50 interviews/mo. Skill variance reporting.
4. **The Fortress (Custom)**: Sovereign clusters. Evervault-sealed logs. Dedicated forensic analysts.

## Commercial Impact & ROI
- **Bad Hire Prevention**: Detected 91% integrity failure in live audits, saving clients **$15,000 per bad hire**.
- **Efficiency**: 5.8x faster technical hiring cycles via autonomous Maya sessions.
- **Bias Reduction**: 99% reduction in human heuristic bias via multi-agent consensus scoring.
