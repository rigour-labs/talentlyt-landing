# TalentLyt: Technical Specification and Product Manifesto

## Product Vision
TalentLyt aims to establish the world-first foundation of technical truth in hiring. By deploying a high-fidelity **Verification Hierarchy**, we separate the interaction layer from the technical validation stream, ensuring a 100% verified technical signal and predictive success forecasting.

## Architecture: The Sentinel Hierarchy
The core of TalentLyt is a decentralized multi-agent system that performs continuous cross-verification through sub-millisecond consensus.

### Maya AI 2.0 (The Conversational Lead)
- **Role**: Real-time adaptive technical screening and claim extraction.
- **Adaptive Probing**: Maya dynamically adjusts interview depth based on candidate reasoning, probing specific technical claims for grounding.
- **Claim Extraction**: Automatically identifies and isolates technical skills and experience claims for downstream verification.

### Verification Engine (The Truth Stream)
- **Role**: Real-time reasoning stream monitoring and integrity auditing.
- **Signal Synthesis**: Synthesizes 12 independent signals (Voice Bio, Lip-Sync, Gaze, Cognitive Jitter, etc.) to verify session authenticity.
- **Predictive Competency Mapping**: ML-powered forecasting of job success based on technical reasoning patterns and historical performance data.

## Feature Deep Dive

### The Interview Genome (World-First)
A portable, cryptographically signed technical record. Candidates can export their verified depth, allowing companies to browse the TalentLyt Marketplace for pre-verified talent with high-integrity signals.

### Job Success Prediction
Using federated collective intelligence, TalentLyt provides an **85% accurate forecasting** of a candidate's technical performance in a specific role context, moving beyond static assessment to predictive intelligence.

### Symbiotic AI (Maya Whisper)
Empowers human interviewers with real-time technical context, suggesting probing questions and providing instant claim verification during live panel interviews.

## Security, Privacy & Ethics
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Uses ephemeral in-memory processing for biometric signals, adhering to GDPR/BIPA with Zero-Storage identity verification.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Standardized objective evaluation protocols remove human heuristic bias, focusing solely on technical meritocracy.
- **Federated Learning**: Models improve through anonymized signals across organizations without ever sharing raw candidate data.
